## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of C++ modules that I have developed over time. These modules are designed to solve specific problems and enhance the functionality of C++ applications. Each module is carefully crafted with efficiency, reliability, and maintainability in mind.

## Features

- **Module 1**: A powerful module that provides advanced data structures for efficient data manipulation.
- **Module 2**: An innovative module that offers algorithms for complex computations and optimizations.
- **Module 3**: A versatile module that simplifies file handling and IO operations.
- **Module 4**: A comprehensive module that facilitates network programming and communication.

## Installation

To use the modules in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Build the modules using your preferred C++ compiler: `make`
4. Include the desired module header files in your C++ project: `#include <module1.hpp>`

## Usage

Once you have installed the modules, you can start using them in your C++ projects. Here's a simple example of how to use Module 1:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <module1.hpp>

int main() {
	// Create an instance of the data structure
	Module1::DataStructure ds;

	// Perform operations on the data structure
	ds.insert(42);
	ds.remove(10);
	int value = ds.get(0);

	// Print the result
	std::cout << "Value at index 0: " << value << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

Feel free to explore the other modules and their respective documentation for more detailed usage instructions.
